# Capillary-microfluidic device fabrication for generating double emulsion

General: this protocol describes how to fabricate the microfluidic device using capillaries, which can be used to generate double emulsions. There are 3 main steps: tapering, surface treatment and assembly. Detailed steps are described in the following.

## I. Tapering

(A photo of two tapered glass capillaries needed)
In this step, we use a capillary puller to pull a capillary apart into two pieces, stretching the broken end into tapered tips.
Get several capillaries with circular or square cross sections. This step is not trivial. In order to make the alignment (a step in the Part Three: Assembly) easier, we need to test if the outer edge of the circular capillaries matches the inner edge of the square ones. Pick the best fitted ones and label clearly for future use.

Use a microscope to check if the circular capillaries have secondary layers.

Prepare a petri dish, tape a foam with cuts. Use it as a capillary holder.
Bring all the capillaries to the cleanroom (code: 2563).
Turn on the pipette puller, set the program according to the following table:

| Heat | Pull   | Velocity | Time | Pressure | Ramp |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| 500      | 0       | 10 | 250 | 500 | 500 |

Note: the parameters above can be modified to produce different tapered shapes. The manual of Micropuller P-1000 provides more information on this.
Make sure the pipette holders are locked. Load a capillary into the socket of (one of) the holders. Twist the knob to lock the capillary.
Note: Always have a finger press on the capillary when it’s not locked. This prevents the capillary from falling down, which can potentially destroy the position calibration of the filament in the machine.
Bring two holders right next to the middle heating filament chamber, release the capillary and let it go through the middle chamber. Then lock both sides.
Close the lid and run the program by pressing the green button.
When there’s no message on the screen, the program is over and the lid may be opened.
Modify the tapered tip using microforge. For this application, the tapered tips should be modified into pairs of big and small diameters. The big one should be 110-130 um in diameter and the small one should be 50-60 in diameter. After loading a capillary on the microforge, we move the part of the tip below the ruler ticks to set a target of forging. Then we heat up the glass bead to melt it, and move it up to the capillary tip to forge. Here are several tips for using the microforge:
The paddle on the floor triggers the heater
Tip has to be flat (not tilted in any direction) for the good performance of the device
When necessary, we need to replace the glass bead for heating. I’m still not clear when this should be done and I should consult Martyna about this.
80-85 C is a good range of temperatures to use, according to my experience.
Note: the lowest possible temperature should be used. Although it makes the process slow, it gives the best forging quality.
When the heater and tip are in contact, I can still move the micro-manipulator a little bit to further align them.
The heater holder can serve as a specimen stage for quickly observing the tips.
Always separate big and small capillaries. They will be treated differently in the next step.

## II. Surface Treatment

Wash both sides of capillaries using water, ethanol and acetone (wash - dry with air gun)
Take a petri dish, add 1 ml chloroform, 4 ml hexane and 10 ul trimethoxy (octadecyl) silane (OTS)
Turn on air flow of the fume hood
Treat for 5 mins and take out and dry
Treat with 5 ml chloroform for another 2 mins
Dry with air gun
Leave on a glass petri dish. Put on a 200 C hot plate and sit overnight.
Note: this treatment makes the surfaces hydrophobic and should only be done to the big diameter tapered capillaries and the square cross section capillaries.
## III. Assemble the device

Glue two pieces of large glass slides together using epoxy.
Stick square capillary to the slide. It should not be in the very middle and the geometry requires careful design.
Use a microscope to align the two tapered capillaries. To turn on the microscope and camera: connect the red cable (power) to the camera, open PCC software.
Put tapered capillaries in the square capillary. Injection is on the left (small) and the collection is on the right (big).
Align the two capillaries: the goal is the small tapered tip can go into the big one.
Adjust the separation between the two tips to a little smaller than the big diameter. I’m not very clear what the purpose of this adjustment is, but I may understand when I actually use the device.
Use glue to fix the aligned capillaries.
Prepare syringe needles for injection and collection.
Use a spinning blade to cut down the tapered tip of the syringe needles
Use a spinning blade to cut notches on the plastic base of the needles. (depending on the application of the needle, the cutting can be either one-sided or double-sided)
Wash the notches on the plastic base using EtOH, to wash out debris.
Glue the needles onto the slides. Note that the epoxy may go into the capillaries and destroy the device. Use a small amount when first fixing the needle. Then use a large amount (of epoxy) to seal all the holes in the device.
