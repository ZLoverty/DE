# Aquapel treatment

This protocol is based on experiment with coverslips (<font color="red">brand?</font>), but should be general to most glass materials.

1. **Wash coverslips with soap water.** Immerse coverslips in soap water and sonicate for _20 minutes_.
2. **Rinse coverslips with water.** Immerse coverslips in DI water and sonicate for _5 minutes_. Dry with compressed air.
3. **Apply aquapel on coverslips.** For each coverslip, put one drop (20-50 ul) aquapel and spread to cover the whole surface using a pipette tip. Let aquapel sit for _3 minutes_ for both sides.
4. **Wash treated coverslips.** Sonicate in isopropanol for 5 minutes and water for another _5 minutes_.
5. **Dry with compressed air and put on a coverslip holder.**

Note:

1. Aquapel remains effective after 3 days. Treated but unused coverslips should be kept for the next experiment (if next experiment is not too far in the future).
