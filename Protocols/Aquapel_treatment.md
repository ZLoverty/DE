# Aquapel treatment

This protocol is based on experiment with coverslips (brand?), but should be general to most glass materials.

1. **Wash coverslips with soap water.** Immerse coverslips in soap water and sonicate for 20 minutes.
2. **Rinse coverslips with water.** Immerse coverslips in DI water and sonicate for 5 minutes. Dry with compressed air.
3. **Apply aquapel on coverslips.** For each coverslip, put one drop (20-50 ul) aquapel and spread to cover the whole surface using a pipette tip. Let aquapel sit for 3 minutes and do the same to the other side.
4. **Wash treated coverslips.** Sonicate in isopropanol for 5 minutes and water for another 5 minutes.
5. **Dry with compressed air and put on a coverslip holder.**

Note:

1. Aquapel remains effective after 3 days. Treated but unused coverslips should be kept for the next experiment (if next experiment is not too far in the future).
