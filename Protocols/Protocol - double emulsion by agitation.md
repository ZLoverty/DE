# Protocol - double emulsion by agitation

## Ingredients

- Motility buffer (MB) ~~with 2 wt% PVA~~
- Hexadecane with ~~2~~ 1 wt% SPAN80 (and 0.5 wt% Oil Red)
- Aquapel
- A swimming pool for bacteria
- Bacteria harvested in mid-log phase
- 3M magic tape
---
## A. Preparation
1. Culture 4 Falcon tubes of **bacteria** (10 ml in each tube)
2. Put MB and hexadecane on a **hot plate**, heat at 40 &deg;C and stir at ~700 rpm
3. Treat the cover slips and the pool with **Aquapel** (for more detailed protocol for Aquapel treatment, see [Aquapel treatment protocol](Aquapel_treatment.md)).

## B. Experiment
1. Centrifuge bacteria
	1. 2400 g 5 min
	2. Dump supernatant, use pipet to thoroughly get rid of the leftover medium
	3. Add 40 ul MB, gently pipet up and down to resuspend the bacterial pellet (usually ~20 cycles for each tube).
	4. After resuspending all bacteria in MB, measure the OD (8 ul bacterial suspensions in 792 ul water, the spectrometer read x 100). The bacterial suspension is ready for the next step.
2. Make double emulsion specimen
	1. Take two eppendorf 1.5 ml tubes, fill both tubes with _500 ul_ hexadecane.
	2. Put _5 ul_ bacterial suspension to _tube 1_, then hit the tube onto a hard surface (like bench) several times until emulsion forms (uniform and turbid suspension).
	3. Transfer _5 ul_ quickly into _tube 2_, gently pipet up and down to make the suspension in tube 2 uniform.
	4. As soon as the suspension is uniform, take ~130 ul (this value depends on the size of the pool) of the suspension and fill the pool, then close the pool with a cover slip. **Pipetting up and down several times when filling the pool can make droplets separate.**
	5. Clean extra oil around the pool with tissues, then seal the chamber with tape (3M magic tape).
3. Mount specimen to confocal
	1. Place specimen on microscope stage, with cover slip facing down.
	2. Align the bottom boundary (bottom when confocal is tilted) with the edge of the image. This step guarantees that in XZ plane, the bottom surface is horizontal so that droplets will not scroll to one side due to gravity.
	3. Use two pieces of (3M magic) tape to fix the specimen.
