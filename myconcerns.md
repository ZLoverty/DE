1. There are 3 (4 including the current one) projects to finish. How long do I expect to finish each and what are the expected outcomes? (papers? or just more data?) If it's not realistic to push out papers for all the projects, what will be your priority list?

2. Salary?

3. I need a convention d'accueil to apply for residence permit extension, before the end of January.
4. French is a problem?
