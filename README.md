# DE
DE stands for Double Emulsion.
It's the experimental system I am working with at PMMH-ESPCI with Eric Clement, Anke Lindner and Teresa Lopez-Leon.
The project is a combination of the double emulsion system and active matter.
In particular, I will be studying
- the diffusion of a droplet in an active bath
- the swimming of bacteria on curved surfaces

In this repository, I save the notes, code, illustrations and eventually the draft for the research paper of this project.
