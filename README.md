# DE

DE stands for Double Emulsion.
It's the experimental system I am working with at PMMH-ESPCI with Eric Clement, Anke Lindner and Teresa Lopez-Leon.
The project is a combination of the double emulsion system and active matter.
In particular, I will be studying
- "Thermometer" in an active bath

In this repository, I save the notes, code, illustrations and eventually the draft for the research paper of this project.

## "Thermometer" in an active bath

#### Project summary

We devise a "thermometer" for an active bath using double emulsions.
Specifically, we confine swimming *E. coli* bacteria in the aqueous phase of oil/water/oil double emulsions and examine the motions of the inner oil droplets.
Surrounded by swimming bacteria, the inner oil droplets exhibit stronger fluctuations, deviating from familiar Brownian motion.
In this study, we combine microfluidic techniques and advanced imaging techniques to investigate:
- generalized temperature in active matter systems
- whether boundary conditions, especially curvature, affect the temperature
- to what extent thermodynamic tools can be generalized to active matter systems
