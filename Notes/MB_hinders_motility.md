# Motility Buffer (MB) Hinders the Motility of Fluorescent _E. coli_ (AD62)

## I. AD62 with and without MB

Two videos from the same day shows that AD62 slows significantly and forms clusters in the presence of MB or BMB. When MB is replaced with water, AD62 swims faster and less clusters are observed.

## II. Is the MB too old?

The MB in the previous experiment was prepared 2 weeks before the experiment. While this is not typically considered "too old", I did a test with freshly prepared MB. _Freshly prepared: made on 11/29 and used on 12/01._

## III. MB has stronger effect on AD62 (than JEK _from Chile_)

**MB seems to be strain specific.** Two bacterial strains are used in my experiment: AD62 and JEK. AD62 as the fluorescent bacteria and JEK as the wild type. MB significantly hinders the motility of AD62. However, its effect on JEK is not very pronounced. _It could be the case that clusters are more obvious in fluorescent images. JEK can only be imaged in bright field, so I don't find obvious clusters. But based on the motility of JEK, there shouldn't be a lot of clusters._
