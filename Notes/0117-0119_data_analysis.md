# 0117-0119 Data Analysis

Analysis on the collective motions in droplets data. Since the collective motion is much strong in this data set, I start a new note analyzing the new data.

## I. Statistics of the data set (will be a TOC later)

### A. Overview

Total number, total length, link to experiment logs.
How many different droplets imaged?

### B. Serine effect

### C. Percoll effect

### D. Laser effect

### E. Life time of a droplet

### F. Others

## II. Confirmed steady state?

## III. How much does serine enhance the motility?

## IV. Does blue laser make a difference?

## V. Percoll??

## VI. Frozen droplets
