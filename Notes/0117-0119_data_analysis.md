# 0117-0119 Data Analysis

Analysis on the collective motions in droplets data. Since the collective motion is much strong in this data set, I start a new note analyzing the new data.

## I. Overview of the data set

During the 3-day experiment, I have taken 78 videos of 22 different droplets. Most of the droplets contained highly active and dense bacteria (68 videos of 12 droplets), except those for testing percoll and serine effects (10 videos of 10 droplets). Among the 12 droplets, 3 are dedicated to the XY-XZ difference investigation, and all can be used to study the steady-state. [For a complete structured log, click here](Data\structured_log\structured_log.ods).

The sizes of droplets are carefully chosen, so that they span the range from 28 to 112 um nicely, providing a good ground for investigating the size dependence. Moreover, the concentrations of bacteria in these droplets center around 185. Strong collective motions are observed in all the droplets in the beginning of each experiment, so the concentration effect can be neglect in the first analysis. The graph below shows the droplet size and OD distribution of this data set.

## II. Experimental subtleties

### A.Serine effect

Bacteria swim significantly faster and last longer with the addition of L-serine. Compare the two videos: [Video: with serine](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13AmyeAelieYmGZzB1sTbPr1HU4LrCKRJ&authuser=liux3141%40umn.edu&usp=drive_fs) and [Video: without serine](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1S35GxkcylCAK8tRshJNpPtZJlCH9gpmc&authuser=liux3141%40umn.edu&usp=drive_fs), difference can be told without further quantification.

### B. Percoll effect

1. Centrifuge with percoll fails. Tried a higher centrifuge speed (5000 g) but still no pellet. Got a very dilute suspension.
2. Adding percoll at the final step makes bacteria less active.

### C. Laser effect

The only bright field video in this data set is a droplet of which $D=91$ um diameter and $OD=173$ (0117/0-11). We know that activity is a strong function of droplet size, so we compare this droplet with another droplet that has similar size ($D=93$ um and $OD=197$, 0118/9-14).

I will compare two quantities: mean velocity and the time scale that activity decreases.

#### 1. Bright field

![0117 mean velocity evolution](../images/2022/01/0117-mean-velocity-evolution.png)

In the first 20 minutes, the mean velocity is roughly constant. Starting from video 3 (red curve), I start to notice the formation of clusters in the middle of the droplet. The activity starts to decrease at roughly this time. So the first 20 minutes can be regarded as "steady state". Below is a simplified velocity evolution of this sample.

#### 2. Confocal (blue laser)



### E. Life time of a droplet

### F. Others

## II. Confirmed steady state?

## III. How much does serine enhance the motility?

## IV. Does blue laser make a difference?

## V. Percoll??

## VI. Frozen droplets
