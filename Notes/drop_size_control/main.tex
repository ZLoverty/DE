\title{Drop size control}
\maketitle

An important investigation in the double emulsion project is to systematically explore how the sizes of droplets influence the dynamics of the system,
in particular the effective temperature of the active bath and the diffusivity of the inner droplet.
Using the capillary microfluidic device, we are able to vary continuously and seamlessly the flow rates of each phase to achieve precise control of drop sizes.
However, it is challenging to control the size of one droplet (inner/outer) independently, because each flow rate affects the sizes of both droplets.
As you can see in Fig.~\ref{fig:vary-middle}, when keeping both inner and outer flow rates constant and only varying the middle phase flow rate $Q_m$, the sizes of both droplets change.
It is most evident when contrasting the cases where $Q_m=700$ $\mu$l/h and $Q_m=200$ $\mu$l/h, where the shell shrinks as desired, but the inner droplet gets larger undesirably.

The results in Utada et al. \cite{Utada2005} explains part of my observation.
Their results suggest that when fixing the sum of the middle and inner phase flow rates, as well as the ratio between the two, the sizes of both droplets only depend on the outer flow rate.
Figure \ref{fig:size-outerflow} illustrates the results of Utada et al., where $R$ is the size of droplets, $Q_o$ is the outer phase flow rate and $Q_{sum}=Q_i+Q_m$ is the sum of the inner and middle flow rates.
As a hypothesis, if we keep $Q_{sum}$ constant and vary the ratio between $Q_i$ and $Q_m$, we can keep the outer droplet constant size and explore the influence of the inner droplet size.
A similar idea is that, if we keep $Q_o+Q_m$ and $Q_i$ constant, and vary the ratio between $Q_o$ and $Q_m$, the inner droplet size might be kept constant.
\textcolor{red}{These two hypotheses remain to be verified in experiment.}
