# Diffusivity and Effective Temperature
One objective of DE project is to measure the effective "temperature" of an active bath.
The idea follows from the [Stokes-Einstein relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_relation_(kinetic_theory)), where the diffusivity of a spherical particle through a viscous liquid is proportional to temperature.
Wu and Libchaber (2000) showed that the diffusion of a sphere in bacterial suspensions is much stronger than its Brownian motion.
If the diffusivity is used to calculate the "temperature", the temperature is ~100 times higher than that of ideal gas.
Wu and Libchaber also showed that the diffusion coefficient in active bath also had a 1/R dependence on the particle size, R, a feature not expected in active systems.

Combine this previous knowledge and our DE system, it becomes interesting to see if the size of a confining droplet (the outer droplet) also changes the effective temperature.
To investigate this topic further, we measure the diffusivity of inner droplets of fixed size within confining droplets of various sizes.
