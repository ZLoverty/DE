# Diffusivity and Effective Temperature
One objective of DE project is to measure the effective "temperature" of an active bath.

The motion of a passive object provides information about a system.
For example, in [Stokes-Einstein relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_relation_(kinetic_theory)), the diffusivity of a spherical particle through a viscous liquid is a measure of temperature.
Wu and Libchaber (2000) showed that the diffusion of a sphere in bacterial suspensions is much stronger than its Brownian motion.
If the diffusivity is used to calculate the effective temperature, it is ~100 times higher than room temperature.
~~They also observed that a he diffusion coefficient has 1/R dependence on particle size R.~~



Combine this previous knowledge and our DE system, it becomes interesting to see if the size of a confining droplet (the outer droplet) also changes the effective temperature.
To investigate this topic further, we measure the diffusivity of inner droplets of fixed size within confining droplets of various sizes.
