OCTOBER
=======
10152021 -- Run double emulsion device and encounter wetting issue 
10192021 -- Run double emulsion device at various inner flow rates. In the dripping regime, inner flow rate shows little effect on the size of inner droplets
10202021 -- Run double emulsion device. Took a necking video. The device got clogged. Also took a video showing the growth of bacterial cluster.
10212021 -- Cristian took some tracks of (i) particle in bulk water (ii) particle in confined bacterial suspensions
10262021 -- Motions of inner droplets in XZ plane / We investigate the cluster issue in bacterial samples.
10272021 -- Motions of inner droplets in XZ plane. Decide to use shaking to produce droplets and double emulsions and study since microfluidic device has issues that requires longer development.

11102021 -- Double emulsions XZ plane - Lower bacterial concentrations concentrations
11112021 -- Double emulsions XZ plane - Lower bacterial concentrations concentrations. Activity is low today.
11162021 -- Particle motion in confined bacterial suspension
11172021 -- Particle motion in confined bacterial suspension, decided to use 2 um particles
