OCTOBER
=======
10152021 -- Run double emulsion device and encounter wetting issue
10192021 -- Run double emulsion device at various inner flow rates. In the dripping regime, inner flow rate shows little effect on the size of inner droplets
10202021 -- Run double emulsion device. Took a necking video. The device got clogged. Also took a video showing the growth of bacterial cluster.
10212021 -- Cristian took some tracks of (i) particle in bulk water (ii) particle in confined bacterial suspensions
10262021 -- Motions of inner droplets in XZ plane / We investigate the cluster issue in bacterial samples.
10272021 -- Motions of inner droplets in XZ plane. Decide to use shaking to produce droplets and double emulsions and study since microfluidic device has issues that requires longer development.

NOVEMBER
========
11012021 -- Continue x-z inner droplet motion imaging.
11022021 -- Continue x-z inner droplet motion imaging.
11032021 -- Continue x-z inner droplet motion imaging.
11102021 -- Double emulsions XZ plane - Lower bacterial concentrations
11112021 -- Double emulsions XZ plane - Lower bacterial concentrations. Activity is low today.
11162021 -- Particle motion in confined bacterial suspension
11172021 -- Particle motion in confined bacterial suspension, decided to use 2 um particles
11182021 -- 2 um particle motion in confined bacterial suspension
11222021 -- Inner droplet motion, same droplet in both XY and XZ plane
11232021 -- Prototype of W/O/W fluctuation experiment

========
DECEMBER
========
12012021 -- Test if AD62 forms clusters in BMB
12062021 -- Test RP437, several AD62 in droplet activity test.
12092021 -- AD62 cluster test, some good videos with water instead of MB.

JANUARY
=======
01052022 -- Circulation in droplets (i) more droplet sizes (ii) image at multiple layers.
01062022 -- Circulation in droplets (i) more droplet sizes (ii) all with time stamps (iii) zero control (iv) z scan of frozen drop
01172022 -- Serine test: very useful. The life of a dense bacterial droplet. 
01182022 -- laser effect / XY-XZ diff / XY-XZ diff w/ percoll. Imaging plane is chosen a little (3 um) below the equator (where a well defined circle can be first seen) to avoid light distortion effect
01192022 -- Flow reactivated in frozen drop.
