## Inputs from Eric, Anke and Teresa
- How to get 3D trajectory?
- **Inner droplet moves along the outer surface?**
  - Require accurate outer drop position
- How I calculate MSD?
  - From 2D trajectory
  - 2D and 3D MSD's are very similar
- **Saturation value of MSD depends on the ratio between two radii?**
  - Require more data to conclude
- **Trajectory and MSD in spherical coordinates?**
  - Good idea, will implement
- Map the kinematics to a rotational diffusion in an external field?
