### Liquid crystal vocabulary (and questions in general)
After the meeting with the Slovenian group, I realize that there are vocabularies in the liquid crystal community that I am not very familiar with. I make a summary here of the questions I have from the meetings and try to figure out before the next meeting. Hopefully, a few rounds of this practice will improve my knowledge base of liquid crystal.
##### What is a tetrahydron configuration?

##### What is hedgehog?
A point defect in nematics.
##### What does cage mean?

##### What is cross polarization?
Cross-polarization, also known as proton-enhanced nuclear induction spectroscopy is a solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) technique to transfer nuclear magnetization from different types of nuclei via heteronuclear dipolar interactions. An imaging technique.
##### What does anchoring mean?
Means the energy penalty for nematic directors to reorient.
##### How does optical effect, like NA of objective, affect the observation of liquid crystal?
