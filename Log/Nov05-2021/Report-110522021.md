## Results

### 1. Videos of double emulsions in X-Z plane

How many, distribution of inner and outer sizes

##### Some interesting observations

- Droplets sometimes suspend in the middle, instead of falling to the bottom
- Inner droplets disappear after several minutes of imaging
- A trick to produce double emulsions in microscope specimen: tapping

##### Preliminary analysis of the X-Z videos

##### Parameter space

### 2. Device is under development

Cut the base of syringe needles (pictures)

## Questions

### 1. Improve the image quality for tracking
- Fluorescent dye for oil droplets?
  - We tried **Oil Red O**. It's red without fluorescence. The contrast between inner droplets and surrounding bacteria is not improved much.
  - We tried **fluorescent bacteria** and image using only laser, the contrast is not satisfactory.

### 2. Confocal disk speed limits our imaging FPS
