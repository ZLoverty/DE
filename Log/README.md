### Log
My research logs for DE project.
Summarize the progress regularly to remind myself the next steps.

#### Updates

- June 06, 2021: it's good to have a graphical abstract for each log to highlight the progress.
- Jan 12, 2022: folder structure change, I no longer use a folder for each log. Instead, each log will just be a .md file under the main "Log" folder. With the help of Markdown writer, images are handled with much more ease and no longer need to be in the same folder as the log. There is no need to update the content in this doc, because the logs are already very handy if I'm in this directory.
- Feb 22, 2022: Still nice to have an all-in-one document to keep track of important events, thoughts and beautiful images.
