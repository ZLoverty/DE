## Effective temperature
See [the note on Diffusivity and Effective temperature](../../Notes/Diffusivity)

## Learn confocal
We are able to rotate the microscope to observe the sample from an angle perpendicular to gravity. A gas valve controls the angular motion.

## Motion in spherical coordinates
See the graphical abstract above.

## DE device issues
Several new devices are not as good as the previous one I used in mid-July.
At the same set of flow rates, I cannot produce DE's of same dimensions.
The most obvious thing that has changed is the **encapsulation rate**.
Previously, with in a range of flow rates, I can achieve ~100% encapsulation.
With the new devices, no matter what flow rate I operate the device at, the encapsulation rate is low.

I presume the issue comes from the imperfect geometry of the devices.
Pay attention to device geometry and try to find the characteristics of a good device in future experiments.
