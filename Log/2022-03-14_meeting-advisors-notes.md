### Committee meeting notes

On Mar 10, 2022, I discussed the double emulsion data with my committee. I summarize here the key messages:

- Concentrate data in the OD range 40-80, because they are closest to the physical picture of the Langevin model.
---
- Consider the drag force differently: a lubrication layer between inner and outer droplets.
- Numerical solution of the non-linear model?
---
- Droplet shrinkage: prevent evaporation
  - saturate water in hexadecane before using
  - double ring pool, use outer ring as water reservoir
  - Water emulsion lens in Gulliver: in the small imaging room.
