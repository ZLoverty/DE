### Questions about theory and simulation

##### 1. Why do you set a correlation time $\tau$ before simulation, then use the simulation results to calculate $\tau$ again? Do you expect them to be different?

$\tau$, the time scale of active noise, lies in the heart of the theory and simulation. The following velocity updating rule in your simulation,

has to be designed in such a way, that velocity $u$ is exponentially correlated, $\left< u(t)u(t') \right>\propto e^{-|t-t'|/\tau}$ (although I don't know how this updating rule enforces this correlation).

Simulation returns $xyzt$ data, you use them to calculate the correlation time again:

Would you expect them to be different? (The only thing that can make $\tau$ different is the reflection boundary condition, and only very frequent occurance can make the difference significant enough to be noticed, IMO)

##### 2. Theoretically, would you expect $\tau$ to be a property of a bacterial suspension and independent of how you measure it?

We've been trying to measure $\tau$ in different ways, e.g. with 2-$\mu$m particles and with oil droplets as tracers. At higher concentration, we can also measure the flow persistence by PIV to get a $\tau$. Are these $\tau$'s expected to be the same (theoretically)?

Looking at the assumptions made in the simulation, any object immersed in an active bath exhibits a noisy motion with exponentially correlated velocity. Hence, I would infer that at least the tau measured from 2-$\mu$m particles should apply to oil droplets. Do you think this is a way to test the assumption?

##### 3. A similar question as Q#1, there are two quantities very similar to each other, $\Pi_3$ and $d_{st}$. The former is an input to the simulation and the latter is the result. How are they different?

Again the only thing that can distinct the two is the boundary condition.
