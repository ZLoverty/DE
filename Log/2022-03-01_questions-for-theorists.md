### Questions

##### 1. The spring model is obtained by expanding the buoyant force to the first order. In experiment, the motion of inner droplets often go beyond this limit. I'm therefore wondering, if we expand the buoyant force to higher order terms, can we still solve the Langevin equation, or deduce a time scale?

##### 2. The active diffusivity $D_A$ seems to be a better parameter, since it does not diverge in the $\tau\to0$ limit. Because of the diverging of $A$, I'm wondering if we should reconsider the interpretation of $v_{bath}$?

##### 3. Please find the OD for the following experiments:

- experimentoDE_7_11_19_30fps_60x_exp2_1003
- experimentoDE_7_11_19_30fps_60x_exp3003
- experimentoDE_15_10_19_30fps_exp2_60x003
- experimentoDE_15_10_19_30fps_exp2_60x004
- experimentoDE_29_10_19_30fps_exp2_3
- experimentoDE_29_10_19_30fps_exp3_1

##### 4. See the data summary and let me know what you think.
