Consider a unit cell containing a light-absorbing object with an arbitrary shape, as shown in the schematic above. Let's assume the medium outside the object does not absorb any light (i.e. $\epsilon=0$). The incoming light has power $P_0$ on the upper surface of this cell. This light gets weaker as it propagates through the cell and ends up with power $P_L$ at the bottom of the cell. The cell has a length $L$ along the direction of the incoming light, the $z$-direction. $S_z$ denotes the cross section area of the object at position $z=z$.

We use the weak attenuation approximation of Beer's law:
$$
I = (1 - \epsilon lc) I_0
$$
where $I_0$ is the original light flux and $I$ is the attenuated light flux. Note that the power of the light is the product of flux and area.

Using this approximation, we can examine the differential power difference at position $z$.
$$
dP = -\epsilon c S_z dz
$$
Integrate over the whole cell
$$
\int_{P_0}^{P_L}dP = -\epsilon c \int_0^L S_z dz
$$
Noticing that the integral on the RHS is the volume of the object $V_{obj}$, we have
$$
P_L = P_0 - \epsilon c V_{obj}
$$
